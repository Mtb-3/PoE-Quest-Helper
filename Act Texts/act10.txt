"When Kitava's hand is glowing red, be ready to dodge as the next slam attack will send a shockwave forward. Kitava slowly drags his arm across the arena. You can run to the other side or time your dash ability to jump over it. Kitava clenches his fist which signals four small explosions that will move towards you ending with a large explosion. Move as soon as you see the smaller red explosions on the ground. He has a charged beam swipe and flame breath attack. Be ready to use your movement ability when you see his head move back.

 Kitava's heart falls out when he reaches 80% health. Adds begin to spawn however focus mainly on the heart unless the adds begin to overwhelm you. When Kitava is below 25% health his flame breath attack now covers almost the entire area. There is a safe spot on the opposite side of where the attack began. You can set up a portal in the arena to dodge abilities as well. The beam orbs will attack below them. Try to avoid the area under them.
