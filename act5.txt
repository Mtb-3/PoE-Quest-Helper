>Kill Kitava<
"When Kitava's hand is glowing red, be ready to dodge as the next slam attack will send a shockwave forward. Kitava slowly drags his arm across the arena. You can run to the other side or time your dash ability to jump over it. Kitava clenches his fist which signals three small explosions that will move towards you ending with a large explosion. Move as soon as you see the smaller red explosions on the ground. Kitava's heart falls out when he reaches 80% health. Adds begin to spawn however focus mainly on the heart unless the adds begin to overwhelm you. 

"Once you bring Kitava to 50% health he applies a curse on you which will lower all your elemental resistances by 30%. Head to your hideout and see if you can craft any additional resistances on your gear. In Act 6, be on the lookout for gear with health + resistances along with the links and colours you require.
